Project "Segment-based Classification of Laser Range Data" -- Summer Term 2015

Group4: Mohamad Sharaf and Ahmed Abdelbaki

Summary of Milestone 1
  1. (PASSED) Octree: initialization: 3 points
  2. (PASSED) Octree: radius neighbor search: 2 points
  3. (PASSED) Grid-based segmentation: 3 points
    Remarks: In your region growing code, you actually have to use nwX, nwY to access 
    neighboring grid cells. Currently, your segmentation produces only segments containing 
    a single grid cell due to this error. You furthermore have to reset the grid cells 
    with every new segmented scan (including minZ, maxZ).
    
  4. (PASSED) Spin Image computation: 2 points
    Remark: You should either use bilinear interpolatation or none, not both, i.e., increasing by
    one and furthermore adding (1-a)*(1-b).

Summary of Milestone 2
  5. (PASSED) Bag-of-Words computation: 3 points
  6. (PASSED) K-means clustering: 3 points
  7. (PASSED) Objective of softmax regression: 4 points
    Remark: You should only substract the regularization once, not everytime.
    Therefore, you are efficiently calculating the objective without the 1/N factor.
